# At-risk-measure sampling
This repository is intended to accompany the manuscript entitled *At-risk-measure sampling in case-control studies with aggregated data*.

1. Code to produce the two figures
2. Code to simulate a simple example to illustrate Condition 3
3. A more complicated but more realistic simulate dataset where there is
   correlation of variables within groups of segments (streets).

    #In this dataset, the following procedures are illustrated:
      #A. Variance estimation via hierarchical bootstrapping
      #B. Inverse probability of selection weighting
      #C. Confounding control via a weighted geometric mean
